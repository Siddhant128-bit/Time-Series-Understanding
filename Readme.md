<h3 align='left'>Part I: The Theoretical Bedrock of Time Series Analysis </h3>
<p>
    A robust understanding of the statistical properties inherent in time-series data is the indispensable foundation upon which all reliable forecasting models are built. Without this theoretical grounding, the application of even the most sophisticated machine learning algorithms becomes a high-risk exercise in pattern-matching without comprehension, often leading to models that are brittle, misleading, and perform poorly on unseen data. This section establishes that essential foundation, covering the core components of time series, the critical concept of stationarity, and the diagnostic tools used to identify underlying data structures.
