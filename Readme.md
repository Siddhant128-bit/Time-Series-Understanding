<h3 align='left'>Part I: The Theoretical Bedrock of Time Series Analysis </h3>
<p>
    A robust understanding of the statistical properties inherent in time-series data is the indispensable foundation upon which all reliable forecasting models are built. <b> Without this theoretical grounding, the application of even the most sophisticated machine learning algorithms becomes a high-risk exercise in pattern-matching without comprehension, often leading to models that are brittle, misleading, and perform poorly on unseen data.</b> This section establishes that essential foundation, covering the core components of time series, the critical concept of stationarity, and the diagnostic tools used to identify underlying data structures.

<p>
    <b>Time series is an art and science of understanding data points ordered throughout time.</b>The initial and most crucial step of forecasting project is to decomppose the observed points into its components to understand its underlying structure.
    <br>
    These components are typically categorized as: 
    <ol>
        <li> Trend </li>
        <li> Seasonality </li>
        <li> Cyclicity </li>
    </ol>
