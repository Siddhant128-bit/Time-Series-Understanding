# A Comparative Analysis of Models for Time Series Forecasting #
## Part I: Foundational Paradigms in Predictive Modeling
### 1.1 The Landscape of Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a specialized field of machine learning dedicated to predicting future values based on historically collected data points ordered in time.1 Unlike standard regression or classification problems where data points are often assumed to be independent, time series data is characterized by its temporal dependency, where each observation is related to its predecessors.2 This unique structure requires models that can understand and extrapolate patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cycles.

A time series can be broken down into several key components 

Trend: The long-term increase or decrease in the data.
Seasonality: A repeating pattern that occurs at fixed and known intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or yearly).

Cycles: Patterns that repeat but do not have a fixed period, unlike seasonality.

Noise: Random, irregular fluctuations that are not explained by the other components.

The fundamental goal is to create a model that can distinguish the underlying signal (trend, seasonality, cycles) from the noise to make accurate predictions about the future.1 At the heart of this challenge lies the bias-variance tradeoff.5 Bias refers to the simplifying assumptions made by a model. High-bias models may fail to capture complex temporal patterns (underfitting). Variance refers to how much a model's prediction would change if trained on different data. High-variance models can be overly flexible and model the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on future data (overfitting).6 The evolution of forecasting models, from classical statistical methods to complex neural architectures, represents a continuous effort to navigate this tradeoff and effectively model the intricate dynamics of time-dependent data.


### 1.2 Linear Models: From Regression to ARIMA

Linear models serve as a foundational benchmark in time series forecasting, prized for their simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability.8 While a basic Linear Regression can be adapted for forecasting, more specialized models like ARIMA are designed specifically to handle the temporal dependencies inherent in time series data.3

### Mechanism

Linear Regression: In its simplest application to time series, linear regression models the target variable as a linear function of time or other time-derived features (e.g., dummy variables for seasons).8 It is effective for data with a clear and stable linear trend but struggles with more complex patterns.8

### ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): 

This is a more sophisticated class of linear models that is one of the most widely used approaches for time series forecasting.10 ARIMA models predict future values based on a linear combination of past values and past forecast errors. The model is defined by three parameters: (p, d, q).11

#### Autoregressive (AR - parameter p): 
This component regresses the current value of the series against its own previous values. The parameter p defines the number of past (lagged) observations to include in the model.11

#### Integrated (I - parameter d): 

This component addresses non-stationarity. A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties (like mean and variance) do not change over time.10 If a series is non-stationary (e.g., it has a trend), it can be made stationary by "differencing," which involves subtracting a previous value from the current value. The parameter d specifies the number of times differencing is performed.11

#### Moving Average (MA - parameter q): 

This component models the relationship between an observation and the residual errors from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. The parameter q defines the number of past forecast errors to include in the model.11

#### Pros and Cons for Time Series Forecasting
The primary advantage of linear models like ARIMA is their interpretability and simplicity.3 They are well-suited for shorter-term forecasts and work effectively with stationary data or data that can be made stationary through differencing.3

However, their main drawback is the core assumption of linearity.8 They perform poorly when the underlying relationship in the time series is non-linear and can struggle to capture complex seasonal patterns or long-term dependencies.3 Furthermore, ARIMA models often require manual intervention to identify the optimal parameters (p, d, q), typically by analyzing autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots.10
